    <p class="textIntro">The year 2025 was marked by a seismic event of great magnitude,<br>
        which generated concern on a global scale. A strong earthquake struck the region of Myanmar,<br>
        a country neighboring Turkey, causing destruction and mobilizing humanitarian aid efforts. Although the epicenter was located in Myanmar, its proximity to Turkey, a country that unfortunately<br>
        already has a recent history of significant seismic activity, has further raised the level of alert and international commotion.<br>
        Authorities in both countries are working to assess the extent of the damage, the number of victims and the most urgent needs of the affected situations.</p>
